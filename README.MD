# Vaadin App for rendering Designs

This is a quick prototype of a Vaadin app that simply renders Designs with a specified theme.

## How to use

 * To try out just the Vaadin application, run `./gradlew bootRun`
 * To run as an Electron app, run `./gradlew electron` followed by `npm start` in the `build/electron` directory
 * To package as an Electron app, run `./gradlew electronPackage`. The app is packaged to `build/app`
